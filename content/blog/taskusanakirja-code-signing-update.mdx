Howdy! Welcome to Siilikuin, the software company behind
[Taskusanakirja](https://taskusanakirja.com/),
our Finnish-English pocket dictionary software.

Despite how it looks, Taskusanakirja is fully cross-platform. It works
identically on Windows, Mac, and Linux. We even have all three operating
systems in-house to test this on!

However, the current
downloads are not yet "code signed". Microsoft and Apple don't yet
know this is software from a legitimate business
yet. TL;DR: If you're on one of these platforms, **you're unfortunately
going to have to wait until our next release** to install Taskusanakirja.
After that, you should have no issues with just downloading the
program and running it with a double-click!

## What's Happening?

When you download Taskusanakirja, Windows and macOS may show security
warnings. This happens because we haven't yet "code signed" our software -
a process where developers obtain certificates from Microsoft and Apple
that verify their identity as a legitimate business.

Code signing is like a digital seal of approval. It tells your operating
system "this software comes from a known, verified developer." Without
it, your OS errs on the side of caution and warns you about potentially
unsafe software - even though Taskusanakirja is completely safe and
contains no malicious code.

## Why the Delay?

As a brand new software company, we're navigating the code signing
process for the first time. Getting these certificates isn't as simple
as filling out a form - and they wouldn't be worth much safety-wise if
it was! It involves:

- **Business verification**: Microsoft and Apple need to verify we're a real, registered company.
- **Platform-specific requirements**: Each OS has its own certificate authority and process.
- **Processing time**: Approval can take days to weeks depending on the platform.

We started this process after launching Taskusanakirja, which means our
current release doesn't have these certificates yet. Our next release
will be properly signed on all platforms.

## Timeline

We expect to have code signing certificates in place within the next 2-3
months. (Long lead time, I know, but Siilikuin is a tiny
weekends-and-evenings shop - we're doing our best!)
Once obtained, we'll immediately release signed versions of
Taskusanakirja that run without any warnings.

## Our Promise

We understand that security warnings can be concerning. That's why we're
prioritizing getting our code signing certificates sorted immediately.
As a small team building our first product, we're learning these
industry requirements as we go, and we appreciate your patience.

Taskusanakirja contains no tracking, no ads, and no malicious code.
Indeed, we collect far _less_ data than most apps you use ever day -
just check our
[Privacy Policy](https://taskusanakirja.com/privacy-policy/).
The warnings you see are purely administrative.

Thank you for your patience!
